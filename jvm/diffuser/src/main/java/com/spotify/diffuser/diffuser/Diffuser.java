/**
 * A Diffuser wraps a side-effecting function.
 *
 * <p>When {@link #run(Object)} is called on a Diffuser, it will decide if it should forward the
 * supplied arguments to its side-effecting function. E.g., Diffusers created using {@link
 * #into(Effect)} and {@link #intoAll(Diffuser[])} only forward calls when the input value is
 * different from the previous value, or if {@link #run(Object)} was called for the first time.
 * {@link #intoWhen(DidChange, Effect)} can be to specify more nuanced caching. {@link
 * #intoAlways(Effect)} will always run its function.
 *
 * <p>Diffusers can be combined to orchestrate groups of side-effects. E.g., {@link
 * #intoAll(Diffuser[])} can be used to merge a list of Diffusers with the same input type, and
 * {@link #map(Function, Diffuser)} can be used to change a Diffuser's input type
 *
 * @param <A> The type of values that this Diffuser can be {@link #run(Object)} with.
